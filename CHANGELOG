6/16/17:    Release 0.96

    - New build framework for different platforms and different boards
      Board-dependent initalization and console definition is now located
      in separate files. Python build scripts have now a library of platforms
      to do a platform-dependent stuff in a separate module.

    - A simple bootloader is written into a separate file. It can be used
      instead of board 0xBFC00000 bootloader. It just initializes CPU/caches/etc
      and jumps to tinyVP initialization.

    - Microchip DM320007 board support and test guest

    - Olimex PIC32-EMZ64 board support and test guest

    - pic32prog is update to latest release


5/25/17:    Release 0.95

After testing with MyNewT RTOS from Runtime.io a couple of bugfixes:

    - FPU and DSP context save/restore  :)

    - bzero call is now correct register set

    - insert_IRQ now queues IRQ if it does exist, prevents skipping it

    - Console issues a virtual input IRQ request if input is available

    - A couple of bugfixes in IC emulator, the adequate offsets, the correct
      place to finish IRQ (before a new IRQ is injected), priority limitation
      is fixed, signed vs unsigned in IPL processing etc

New features:

    - Essential change of timekeeping: switch to 64bit time and count with
      high word as "generation" + a correct sequence of save/restore timing
      registers to prevent a timer interrupt loss.

    - Guest CP0 Wired support

    - New console commands are added for VM debug

    - A little change of an automated build process to allow a multiline build
      shell macro (optional OFFSET)

    - Empty device emulator is added to allow using MIPS SW0/SW1 interrupts.
